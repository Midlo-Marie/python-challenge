# This is the main routine for the PyBank exercise
#
# Requirements

# Our task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

# The total number of months included in the dataset
# The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
# The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
#

# Initialize variables used for sums
total_months = 0
net_total = 0
greatest_increase = 0
greatest_increase_month = 0
greatest_decrease = 0
greatest_decrease_month = 0
# 
# Initialize empty lists for keeping months and monthly changes
month_count = []
month_change = []

# Include the operating system module which allows creation of file paths across systems

# Also include the module for reading and operating on CSV files
import csv

# Identify the path location of the data file, currently in local directory
